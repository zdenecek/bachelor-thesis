In this thesis, we embarked on the development and subsequent performance analysis of a Python implementation of the Ataccama Expression Language. The objective was to create a programmatic bridge allowing data scientists and analysts to utilize Ataccama's powerful data quality rules within Python, a language celebrated for its straightforward syntax and broad adoption across scientific and analytical computing. The implementation phase was challenging yet insightful; it involved translating Ataccama's statically typed Java-based expression language into Python’s inherently dynamic type system. This required not only a deep understanding of both languages’ paradigms but also a creative approach to maintain the robustness and efficiency of the data quality rules. We integrated features that enabled users to execute comprehensive data quality checks directly within Python, making it an invaluable tool for real-time data analysis and processing.

The subsequent phase of the project involved a meticulous performance analysis to determine the practicality of the Python implementation in operational environments. This analysis was centered on execution time comparisons with established data quality platforms such as Soda Core and Great Expectations, across various dataset sizes ranging from small to large scales. Despite slower execution times in certain scenarios, the results were promising. The Python implementation managed to perform within a tolerable slowdown range, typically less than ten times slower than the baseline. This confirmed its viability for scenarios where the ease of integration and the flexibility offered by Python are more critical than the highest possible performance. The detailed analysis also highlighted specific areas where performance could potentially be improved, providing clear pathways for future optimizations.

This thorough exploration of both development and analysis not only confirms the feasibility of Ataccama's rules in Python but also opens up numerous possibilities for their application in complex data environments. The successful integration of these rules into Python's ecosystem marks a significant advancement in making sophisticated data quality management tools more accessible to a wider audience, empowering users to ensure data integrity and reliability in their analytical workflows.
